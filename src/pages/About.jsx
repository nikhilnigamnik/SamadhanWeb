        <p>
          Samadhan is a web app developed with the aim of helping people in
          villages communicate directly with the Minister of Villages. Our
          platform provides an avenue for villagers to describe the problems
          they face, such as water scarcity, electricity issues, or road
          conditions, and seek timely solutions from the Minister.
